## Part 1: What is deep learning?

The notebooks of Part 1 accompany the introductory lecture. They are meant as an additional help for understanding the provided answers to _"What is deep learning?"_ and indicate an answer to _"How do you _do_ deep learning?"_ for those unfamiliar with the field.

### Notebooks

* `DL-Example-1-image_classification-MedNIST-using-PyTorch.ipynb`. This notebook will provide a translation of the lecture's description of deep learning into PyTorch code, using a simple image classification example (the MedMIST data set collected by Dr. Bradley J. Erickson). 

* `DL-Example-2-image_classification-using-fastai.ipynb`. This notebook repeats the above story by using more advanced image classification techniques, and also extends it to more difficult data sets. It also contains some examples of techniques one would use to improve model performance, including data augmentation, test-time augmentation and model ensembling. Working through this notebook will give you a useful reference point for your further exploration of deep learning, and provide a bridge to the more advanced examples of Part 2.

### More 

If you feel like exploring the basics further, the accompanying lecture points at some resources. The most important recommendation is to _experiment_. _A lot!_ 

> "Learning by doing" is a very good approach in such experimental fields as deep learning.
